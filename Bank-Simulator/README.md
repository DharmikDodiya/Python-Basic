# This program allows the user to interact with a MySQL database to simulate basic banking operations. It enables the creation of a database and table, user account management, and secure transactions. Below is the overview of the system's features

**Features**
- Database Creation & Credential Storage:

-The user is prompted to input the following details:
- Hostname
- Username
- Password
- Database name
- Table name

- The system validates the MySQL username and password. If valid, it creates the specified database and table.
- The database credentials are then encrypted and stored in a creds folder for secure access. This folder will only be created once, and future uses will retrieve credentials from it.
